    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Every day we are confronted with small frustrations, one we ignore more easily than the other. The fact is that nobody likes to throw food away. Strangely enough, it is a daily habit in many companies and families. We decided to take action when we saw perfectly edible food end up in the garbage after a reception... That food was literally Too Good To Go.</p>
    <p>After that confrontation, some entrepreneurs from Europe decided to join forces. They started developing the app that is Too Good To Go today. An app with which everyone can contribute to the fight against food waste.</p>
    <p>You enjoy delicious food while supporting the local trader. The trader actively reduces his waste and gets new customers. Together with the trader you contribute to a better world. Win-Win-Win!</p>
    <p>We know habits are hard to learn. Our mission is to make people think differently about wasting food. We succeed more and more every day! Thanks to our community, we grow at an incredible pace and together we save more and more food.</p>
